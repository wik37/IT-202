RewriteEngine On

# Below condition is strictly for Heroku https://help.heroku.com/VKLSBMJS/why-am-i-getting-a-message-too-many-redirects
# Basically, the request to Heroku Router is HTTPS but internal requests are HTTP, using the standard RewriteCond for HTTPS creates infinite redirects 
# This checks to make sure the connection is not already HTTPS
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]

# Redirects non-phpmyadmin requests to public_html so it becomes the root directory to server your work
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !phpmyadmin/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !public_html/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public_html/$1 [L]
